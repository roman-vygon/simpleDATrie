# simpleDATrie
This is a C++\Python implementation of Double Array Trie.

## Double Array Trie
You can read about the Trie data structure on the [Wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie).
The Double Array Trie lets you store a Trie in two arrays. The algorithm is described [here](https://linux.thai.net/~thep/datrie/).

## Implementation

The code is ported from java implementation from [digitalstain/DoubleArrayTrie](https://github.com/digitalstain/DoubleArrayTrie), which was later improved by [Tsugiru](https://github.com/Tsugiru/DoubleArrayTrie) and [codelogicanalysis](https://github.com/codelogicanalysis/DoubleArrayTrie). I merely ported their code to C++ and Python.

There exists a much better implementation of Double Array Trie in [libdatrie](https://github.com/tlwg/libdatrie). However, this code seems simpler and more straightforward if you just need a base implementation.
